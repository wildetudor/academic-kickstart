I am an Oxford graduate with a passion for science and for music. Having built-up a methodological toolkit for psychology and neuroscience in my graduate studies (where I did psychophysics and numerical cognition), I have thereafter moved to music cognition, where my heart lies, and to which I currently devote my efforts. 

I am presently a postdoc at the University of Vienna, where I investigate the brain bases of our capacity for language and music.

In my research I employ a broad spectrum of quantitative methods, including or borrowing from: neuroimaging, neuropsychology, music theory, linguistics, data science, and statistics. My research has been published in high-impact journals such as [Science](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6468/944), [Cortex](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945218303356?via%3Dihub), [Neuropsychologia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393215302682), [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-35873-8), and [Behavioral and Brain Sciences](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/dynamic-hierarchical-cognition-music-and-language-demand-further-types-of-abstracta/2A06A50DAF15EBCC9918B86715178E01); as well as featured in media channels such as the [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9687000/9687032.stm) and the [Ã–RF](https://science.orf.at/v2/stories/2994714/).
